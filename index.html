  Hi, I’m Amjad, a second-year student at the University of Hertfordshire, studying for a bachelors in Computer Science Cybersecurity and Networking. I have a passion for technology and solving complex problems, and I’m constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Alongside my studies, I work part-time at McDonald’s, where I’ve developed strong time management and teamwork skills. Additionally, I’ve been offering private math tuition for over two years, helping students build their confidence and achieve their academic goals.<br><br>
  
  When it comes to technology, I’m particularly passionate about frontend development. I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. On the backend, I’m proficient in Python, Java, and Go, which allows me to build robust and scalable solutions. I take pride in crafting clean, efficient code and enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into functional projects.<br><br>
  
  Outside of academics and work, I lead an active lifestyle. I’m an avid gym-goer and enjoy the discipline and focus that comes with kickboxing. In my downtime, I love playing chess, which sharpens my strategic thinking, and listening to music, which helps me relax and stay inspired.<br><br>
  
  I come from a diverse background, being half Jordanian and half Palestinian. I’m fluent in Levantine Arabic and can read Modern Standard Arabic at a basic level, which connects me to my heritage and broadens my communication skills.<br><br>
